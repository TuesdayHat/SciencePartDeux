##Notes from independent study
* This will almost certainly be a sort of Stream of Consciousness journal, because taking screenshots of webpages to insert in here to prvoe what I was doing seems silly.

* Primary spots planned to work on:
  * set up LinkedIn account -- been meaning to do that for a bit, might as well do it now when I explicitly have personal development time.
  * get started on Machine Learning Udemy course. -- tried a few times before, laptop screen is a little small for some of the early parts (watching video and then moving to code).
