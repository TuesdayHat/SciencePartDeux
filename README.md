## Notes from independent study
* This will almost certainly be a sort of Stream of Consciousness journal, because taking screenshots of webpages to insert in here to prove what I was doing seems silly.

* Primary spots planned to work on:
  * set up LinkedIn account -- been meaning to do that for a bit, might as well do it now when I explicitly have personal development time.
  * get started on Machine Learning Udemy course. -- tried a few times before, laptop screen is a little small for some of the early parts (watching video and then moving to code).

* Reason for those focus points: I'm seeing my primary, overarching weakness as

* as of 9:14 AM, LinkedIn is having server troubles of some sort and I can't create a new account
* [LinkedIn Account Created](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-calhoun-77536315a/)

* read the Freecodecamp article ("I spent 3 months applying to jobs" ... ); have some commentary:
  * don't think I agree with the practice he mentioned where he didn't mention his code bootcamp experience. I may be biased, but that seems a little counterproductive. It looked like he was trying to game the system a bit to get a higher job title than he was actually qualified for and hope he can pick up speed fast enough. No idea whether that made his job search take longer.
    * Bias is mainly that, in my case, I have very, very little on-paper work experience. Vast majority of my work experience is freelance/gig sort of stuff, which in nearly all cases was done cash only. I would not recommend it. Point is, if I left out Epicodus, I'd have a big old blank space from dropping out of college till now. Which can't look good, regardless of how good my GitHub looks.

* Put my LinkedIn profile together. Did everything that looked relevant I could, except a photo -- that'll come tonight (Friday, March 2nd) as soon as I have access to a better camera and lighting. I am particular about the pictures of me floating around.
