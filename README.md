## Notes from independent study
* This will almost certainly be a sort of Stream of Consciousness journal, because taking screenshots of webpages to insert in here to prove what I was doing seems silly.

* Primary spots planned to work on:
  * set up LinkedIn account -- been meaning to do that for a bit, might as well do it now when I explicitly have personal development time.
  * get started on Machine Learning Udemy course. -- tried a few times before, laptop screen is a little small for some of the early parts (watching video and then moving to code).

* Reason for those focus points: I'm seeing my primary, overarching weakness as a lack of on-paper work experience. Previously, all my income was from people who knew me and knew what I could do via being in class or something -- for artwork. I went looking for code schools because that wasn't sustainable at all. I'd get months where I made 90% of the money I was going to this year, and then nothing for the other 11 and no way to know if anything was coming. This *also* means that my resume will have little to nothing on it (A couple of the tech related jobs had an actual paper trail I can point to).
  * So I know I need to show people that I exist and that I know what I'm doing, and also set myself apart from the rest of the recent bootcamp grads that are doing the same thing with the added benefit of an existing resume of any jobs at all from before they started learning to code.
  * I mentioned early on that I had ideas for things I just wanted to make on my own that used machine learning as their central component, so from now through the internship I'm doing as much as I can toward that. It helps that that's an in-demand field right now.
  * I've more or less made peace with the idea that my first 9-5 job will come almost entirely from either knowing someone at the company or he strength of my cover letter and GitHub if I'm not hired directly out of my Internship.

* as of 9:14 AM, LinkedIn is having server troubles of some sort and I can't create a new account
* [LinkedIn Account Created](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-calhoun-77536315a/)

* read the Freecodecamp article ("I spent 3 months applying to jobs" ... ); have some commentary:
  * don't think I agree with the practice he mentioned where he didn't mention his code bootcamp experience. I may be biased, but that seems a little counterproductive. It looked like he was trying to game the system a bit to get a higher job title than he was actually qualified for and hope he can pick up speed fast enough. No idea whether that made his job search take longer.
    * Bias is mainly that, in my case, I have very, very little on-paper work experience. Vast majority of my work experience is freelance/gig sort of stuff, which in nearly all cases was done cash only. I would not recommend it. Point is, if I left out Epicodus, I'd have a big old blank space from dropping out of college till now. Which can't look good, regardless of how good my GitHub looks.

* Put my LinkedIn profile together. Did everything that looked relevant I could, except a photo -- that'll come tonight (Friday, March 2nd) as soon as I have access to a better camera and lighting. I am particular about the pictures of me floating around.

* read the Programmer Competency Matrix; I feel like I'm at or approaching level 2 in a fair number of them. Part of that came from my own research outside of class, or classes I've done before. A few of the definitions I'm not sure what they're asking for:
  * Build Automation: does using the Angular CLI count as setting up a script? Or stringing together a bunch of NPM commands? It doesn't feel like it does, but might technically qualify.
  * under the Programming heading, I like to think I'm level 3 for problem Decomposition and Communication, but are also pretty hard to self evaluate. Still looking at how designing systems that span multiple languages works
    * my first thought is to build a backend with an API that simply isn't front-facing; it only ever talks to other sections of my code. In a sense, it looks a lot like you could build chunks of code that do one specific thing, set up an API for it and pass the results to another chunk through *its* API, essentially treating your components like lego blocks. But I still don't have a good answer for data persistence that's
      * a) Plug & Play (I don't need to explain how to set up a server)
      * b) Holds onto settings between users/machines -- making a save file, basically
      * c) doesn't require an always-on internet connection. Granted, requiring the program to be online seems to be the style these days.
  * Defensive coding I've read a bit about (Turned up in one of the programming books I got foo Humble Bundle), and I feel like I get the concept. I think I've been doing it *less* in the last few weeks, largely because the assignments haven't required it quite so much, and they've also been fairly small, once you ignore the parts that are simply setting up the framework. I've mentioned before how I didn't like how little testing we've done in Javascript.
  * We haven't covered a lot of error handling so far, not sure if it comes up more in Android. The frameworks we've been using seem to incorporate a lot of error handling logic that we've never been required to really dig into.
    * continuing the above thought: Don't think we've ever written tests that simulate errors before.
    * Also haven't written tests for front end logic, but BDD doesn't stress that much -- this guide seems to be written with Testing Driven Design in mind where you don't even write code if it can't be tested.
  * The Requirements section seems like 90% of what I end up doing in the group week projects. For the spotify project the team was sort of split into two pairs working on different halves of the project (since it was based on merging data from two API's), with me acting as the go-between making sure everything both sides wrote played nice with eachother and researching problems I was predicting would come up when both sides were satisfied.
    * Didn't feel like I was doing very much, since I barely touched any actual code. But then I hear from other teams who didn't have someone doing that job and lost hours or days untangling compatibility problems between different parts of the same app. From both other people at Epicodus and people doing this professionally. (Sister: "That's called a Tech Lead/Scrum Master")
  * Functional programming turns up a lot in the guide, and it's something I've been looking into on my own for a while. I get a lot of the concepts in theory, but haven't put the time in yet to get a practical understanding. On the todo list are a couple functional programming languages that turn up as being good at things I want to do in my career (Clojure and Lisp being the standouts).

1:00 PM -- start Machine Learning class.
